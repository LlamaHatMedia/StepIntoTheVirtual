# Step into the Virtual
An Introduction to Building SocialVR Worlds

## Introduction
This repository has been created to acompany a workshop written and delivered by Karl Clarke at the IGGI 2024 Conference at QMUL.

## Contents
This respository contains instructions to create your own first world for SocialVR application VRChat as of August 2024. This repository contains instructions, assets and reccomendations.

### Demonstration
The first stop is "demonstration" where you can read the notes made for this presentation. This should guide you on how to make a VRChat world.

> There is a minimmal experience expectation in both Blender and Unity. By no means are you expected to be proficient but at the very least be familiar with and be able to navigate the interface and create a few objects.
