## Inspiration for this Workshop/Demonstration

This workshop was developed for IGGICon2024, however, lots have been confused as to what I actually do as a part time job. This workshop aims to address how someone is able to make money as a freelancer working by creating bespoke virtual environments. It also aims to identify ways that researchers can use the platform VRChat as a research tool. Further, looking at VRChat not as a game but as a platform to create social experiences.
