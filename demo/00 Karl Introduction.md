# Chapter 0: Karl Introduction

## Background:
- Undergrad: Music and Sound Recording @ University of York
- Postgrad: Audio and Music Technology @ University of York
- PhD (In Progress): Intelligent Games and Games Intelligence
	- The construction and maintenance of social realities in SocialVR environments.

## How I started using SocialVR:

- Get headset (Quest 2) in COVID Lock-down to play BeatSaber
- Explored VRChat for 1 evening, leave it 3 months because it seemed boring
- Explore Virtual Worlds (Meta Horizon) and was thoroughly disappointed
- Go back to VRChat and actually start talking to people and making a small group of friends
- Get curious about building worlds 
- Learn Blender, learn Unity, learn C# because Udon Graph is terrible
- Build Community of creators and musicians
- Start selling custom boutique worlds and tools to other communities or individuals

## My Modelling Journey

I started my journey making simple layouts of rooms as it was simple to make.

I moved onto making more interesting concept worlds with dynamic audio reactive lighting systems.

I am currently at a full stage production section with DMX real-time control of lighting and screens using industry standard lighting & visuals control systems to enhance the performance.
