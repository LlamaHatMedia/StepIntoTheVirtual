I moved onto making more interesting concept worlds with dynamic audio reactive lighting systems.

I am currently at a full stage production section with DMX realtime control of lighting and screens using industry standard lighting & visuals control systems to enhance the performance.

## Inspiration for this Workshop/Demonstration

This workshop was developed for IGGICon2024, however, lots have been confused as to what I actually do as a part time job. This workshop aims to address how someone is able to make money as a freelancer working by creating bespoke virtual environments. It also aims to identify ways that researchers can use the platform VRChat as a research tool. Further, looking at VRChat not as a game but as a platform to create social experiences.

## Goals for the Workshop/Seminar
- Familiarise yourself with Social VR as a concept
- Become familiar with the tools used to create content for SocialVR
- Understand how to create a world for SocialVR
- Gain an appriciation for design descisions made during the creation process
