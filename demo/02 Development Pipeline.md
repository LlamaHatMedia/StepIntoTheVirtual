# Chapter 2: Development Pipeline
In order to make a virtual environment, there are a few different steps to make sure that the process runs smoothly.

Idea -> Modelling -> Texturing -> Developing -> Playtesting
Idea -> Blender -> Substance -> Unity -> VRChat

We will only be covering the Modelling -> Developing area of this pipeline, using Blender to create a room and UV-unwrap, and Unity to texture and build the world.
